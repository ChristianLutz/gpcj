/**
 * <code>Poly</code> is an interface to a complex polygon.  <code>Poly</code> polygons
 * can consist of  multiple "inner" polygons that can be disjoint and can be considered holes.
 * <p>
 * Currently, this interface supports two concepts:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>a set of inner polygons</li>
 *    <li>a set of points of a polygon</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Refactoring.</b> This would be a good place for some refactoring to create
 * a ComplexPoly and an InnerPoly or something so that these two concepts are broken
 * out.  One might also consider changing from an interface to an abstract class,
 * so the methods <code>isContributing()</code> and <code>setContributing()</code>
 * could have an access of package only.  Or, the <code>Clip</code> algorithm could 
 * not store this information in the <code>Poly</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Assumptions.</b> The methods that access the polygon as though it were a set of points assume
 * it is accessing the first polygon in the list of inner polygons.  It is also assumed that
 * inner polygons do not have more inner polygons.
